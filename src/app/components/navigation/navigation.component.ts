/**
 * We have quite some issues here. The component is rather a demonstration of our intend than a functional component.
 *
 * The current implementation doesn't show the pages from the pages config but renders a static list of items instead.
 * That list doesn't match the actual page configuration. We have two pages that are refelcted by a single entry.
 * So we need to do some extra mapping too. This makes this component a demonstration and nothing more right now.
 *
 * 1. Pages Inference
 * How to get the list of all available pages?
 *
 * A) PfePageMappingService's pages attribute is private. Doesn't contain any labels so it's not suitable anyway.
 * B) PfeNavigationService exposes the current page id but not the overall map
 * C) Generated Code Artefact: We know the pages from our pages.json, so we could pass it through injection but
 * the ordered actually doesn't reflect the page flow. So it's not really suited.
 *
 * 2. Page Mapping
 * An ordered list of pages would fix 1) but we also need a mapping for at least those to scenarios:
 * A) One Step relates to multiple pages (currently 'client information' & 'vehicle-information')
 * B) Branching. This is visually unclear and needs to be revisited by the design/concept team.
 *
 * 3. Visual Presentation
 * The given stepper component is based on CDK Stepper. The CDK Stepper seems to be not suited for our imperative usage.
 * The Stepper assumes a slowly built-up state by guiding the user through the individual steps. There is quite some business logic buried.
 * We only need the visuals, full control and almost no logic in the presentation. Right now items can even be clicked (although I set editable to false).
 * That's why I set the poitner events to none â€” to prevent any interaction. This is also something UX & Concept would need to deal with:
 * Will this component ever by interactive? Can a user always jump back? Only selected pages? How does this look like?
 *
